Demo: A Contact Book Built With Python and Textual
Project Overview
Prerequisites
Step 1: Create the Contact Book’s App With Textual
## This file tells Python that rpcontacts/ is a package. The code in the file runs when you import the package or some of its modules. You don’t need to put any code in a __init__.py file to initialize the package. An empty __init__.py file will do the job as well. However, in this case, you define a module-level constant called __version__ to hold the version number of your application. ## 

Step 2: Build the Contact Book’s TUI
